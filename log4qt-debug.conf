# Class/logger specific thresholds now.
# Ones for which threshold is not specified will use root logger's DEBUG level
# Use stricter levels for loggers that you want to shut up

# For example Company class is so stable, you only want ERROR+ messages from it
log4j.logger.Company=ERROR
#log4j.logger.bill=WARN

# console.log() just as qDebug() goes to logger called "Qt" and uses level DEBUG.
# So setting it to INFO would suppress
# console.log() messages
# log4j.logger.Qt=INFO
